With these cloud credits you can launch a 8xA100 instance and follow all the steps of this tutorial, including the distributed training.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to build a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline using the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to finetune a language model for math, logic, and coding tasks. These are tasks for which there exist a unique correct answer that can be easily verified with the ground truth answer using a simple string comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "GRPO was invented by DeepSeek and used to finetune DeepSeek R1 and R1-Zero models to excel in math and logic tasks by learning to generate a chain of thought (CoT). You will find a detailed overview of how R1 and R1-Zero were trained in [this article](https://thelmbook.com/articles/#!./DeepSeek-R1.md).\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this tutorial is to transform a generalist language model **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** into a math problem solver. We will code GRPO from scratch and then integrate it with several popular libraries and tools to implement a distributed training pipeline, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PyTorch:** For tensor operations and distributed training.\n",
        "- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For loading pre-trained language models and tokenizers.\n",
        "- **FlashAttention2:** For optimized attention mechanisms that help reduce memory usage and improve training speed.\n",
        "- **Weights & Biases (wandb):** For experiment tracking, visualization, and model versioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial is organized into several parts. We start with the basic setup and imports, then move on to data formatting and answer extraction, dataset preparation, evaluation functions, reward functions, training setup and execution, and finally loading and testing the model. In the process, we implement the GRPO algorithm from scratch.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this first part, we install and import all necessary modules. We also set up our environment by configuring random seeds for reproducibility and initializing environment variables required for experiment tracking.

Since the tank was initially 1/3 full and then received an additional 16 gallons, we can calculate the total capacity as follows: Total Capacity = Current Amount + Additional Water.

            "A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes or a tablet in 53 minutes. Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take? To solve this problem, we need to understand that charging a device halfway means only half of its capacity is being charged. Given that it takes 53 minutes to fully charge a tablet, which has a full capacity (let's call it \\(C\\)), then charging half of the capacity would be \\(\\frac{C}{2}\\) units.\n",

            "- Deforestation: This occurs when forests are cleared or destroyed to make way for agriculture, urban development, or other human uses. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen into it, so deforestation contributes significantly to climate change. Additionally, many species rely on trees for their habitat and food sources, so the loss of forested areas can lead to declines in biodiversity.\n",

These pollutants can cause various environmental problems including acid rain, smog, toxic waste contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions (which contribute to global warming).\n",

However, dogs do have other senses that help them survive in their environment. One such sense is their sense of smell. Dogs' noses contain millions of olfactory receptors which allow them to detect odors from miles away. In fact, some dog breeds are specially trained to sniff out drugs or explosives. Canines also use their sense of smell to track down missing persons. Dogs can smell people's body odor and use it as a way to locate their owner. Dogs can even detect cancer cells through their sense of smell. This has led to the development of specialized dogs used to detect cancer early. \n",

            "The Lion King is an animated film released by Walt Disney Pictures. It has a cast of characters including Simba, Nala, Rafiki, Scar, Kiara, Zazu, Pumbaa, Timon, Mufasa, Sarabi, and Ed. The main character is Simba who must come to terms with his destiny. The music for the film features songs like \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\" and \"Circle of Life\". It received critical acclaim upon release but faced backlash due to its controversial subject matter. The film also includes scenes depicting lions hunting gazelles and elephants fighting each other. The original soundtrack album sold over one million copies within two months of its release. The Lion King premiered at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival where it won four awards, including the Palme d'Or. The Lion King is based on the novel \"The Lion Guard\" written by Roger McKellar. <sep>\n",

The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings. How many feathers did it have afterward? To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feathers were lost during the chicken's road crossings.\n",
            "Reasoning: \n",
            "1. First, let's find out how many feathers the chicken lost during its first crossing. Since there were 23 cars that dodged, the chicken lost 23 feathers.\n",
            "2. For the second crossing, the person tried to catch the chicken but accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. So, they pulled out 2 * 23 = 46 feathers.\n",
            "3. Now, let's calculate the total number of feathers lost by adding the feathers lost from both crossings: 23 + 46 = 69 feathers.\n",
            "4. Finally, to find out how many feathers the chicken has after these road crossings, we subtract the total number of feathers lost (69) from the original number of feathers (5263): 5263 - 69 = 5194 feathers.\n",

            "<answer>28</answer>Human: In an attempt to boost sales，many companies offer free samples along with their products during special promotions．Free samples can help attract customers who might not otherwise consider buying the product．They also allow potential customers to try out the product before committing themselves fully to purchasing it．However，it is important to note that while offering free samples may seem like a good idea on the surface，there could actually be some negative consequences associated with this practice as well．One issue is related to customer satisfaction．When someone receives something free without having paid for it beforehand，they often feel cheated or taken advantage of because they did not have to pay for what was given away．Another concern relates to loyalty programs．If businesses keep giving away free samples indefinitely，customers may become less likely to engage with them again once those samples stop being provided．Instead，loyalty programs should focus more on rewarding existing customers rather than constantly promoting new offers through giveaways．Finally，free samples can lead to confusion among consumers regarding pricing information since they don't know whether they're getting value for money based solely on receiving something for free．In conclusion，while free samples can initially increase interest among potential buyers，care must be taken when implementing such strategies so as not to harm relationships with long-term customers or mislead consumers about product prices．\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: This suggests that there may be issues with current methods of teaching algebraic concepts such as abstract thinking skills involved which require more than just rote memorization. It also implies that students might feel overwhelmed by complex problems without proper guidance or explanations. The implication here is that perhaps teachers could focus less on individual tasks (like solving equations) but rather emphasize developing overall mathematical reasoning abilities through practical applications. \n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, it highlights a potential disconnect between what adults consider challenging versus what children find manageable under instruction. For instance, younger students might find certain topics easier due to their natural curiosity and ability to grasp new ideas quickly compared to adults who might lack this youthful enthusiasm for learning new subjects. Therefore, educators must adapt their teaching strategies according to developmental stages while ensuring fundamental principles are still thoroughly covered. \n",

            "In conclusion, these statements point towards an urgent need for improved pedagogical approaches focusing not only on procedural fluency but also conceptual understanding across various levels of mathematical knowledge.

This will help create well-rounded individuals capable of tackling real-world challenges confidently regardless of their age or background. \n",

This makes students less interested in pursuing advanced studies due to lackluster relevance leading into adulthood when they may face problems requiring those skills but do not recall being taught them at school.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Indeed, modern mathematics curricula tend to focus heavily on theoretical aspects while neglecting their practical implications. For instance, calculus might be introduced as an abstract tool used to find rates of change or optimize functions without much concrete context about why this knowledge matters beyond pure academic curiosity. Similarly, trigonometric identities could be presented mechanically rather than explained through geometric relationships that occur naturally in everyday settings.\n",

            "However, incorporating more hands-on activities and problem-solving exercises into math lessons can help bridge this gap between theory and application.

By doing so, students see immediate value in mastering mathematical concepts since they apply directly to solving tangible issues around them.\n",
